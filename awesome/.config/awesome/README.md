# TODO:

- Readd titlebar functionalities as keybinds (e.g. pin and on top)
- add control/notification centre
- add ip address [example](https://github.com/arnellebalane/awesomewm-config/blob/98950342b550eb9ea5acc5360cb498ca0d1f6959/widgets/ipaddress.lua)

## Ideas:

- Remap movement keys hjkl so horizontal movement is possible. Needs redoing resizing keys as well.
- make BG of selected items in bars orange and text black
- add [rubato](https://github.com/andOrlando/rubato) timing, [creator's dots](https://github.com/andOrlando/nix-dotfiles/tree/main/bennett/awesome)
